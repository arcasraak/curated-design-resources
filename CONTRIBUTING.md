# Contribution
_To contribute, or not to contribute, that is the question!_

**Hey there!** The future contributor of this lovely project,

I'm sure you will find it quite easy to contribute to the project. You will find a step-by-step instruction down below to make it even more easier for you to contribute. 

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

### Instructions

Throughout the instructions I will use the Tailwind resource as an example.

#### 1. Updating the README.md file
Open the [README.md](README.md) file and find the proper section for your resource and enter the information as in the example below. **You must enter the new resource in alphabetical order in the list.**

    - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.

#### 2. Updating the section's data file
These YAML files are feeding the web site's content. So, it is necessary to enter the same information here. Navigate to the `data` folder and open the related section's yaml file (in our example the `frontend-design.yaml` is the proper one) and add the resource here one more time as in the below example. **It must be in alphabetical order and the order of the information you provide must be same as in the example!**

    - title: Tailwind CSS
      description: Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
      link: https://tailwindcss.com/

#### 3. Use the Pull Request title format
Pull request title must include the resource name and the resource section name as in the example below.**You may use the same convention for your commit message!**
